      "{'text': 'OpenAI, Inc. is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization founded in December 2015 and headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop \"safe and beneficial\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\".[6] As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,[7] OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora.[8][9] Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI.\\n\\nThe organization has a complex corporate structure. As of April 2025, it is led by the non-profit OpenAI, Inc.,[1] registered in Delaware, and has multiple for-profit subsidiaries including OpenAI Holdings, LLC and OpenAI Global, LLC.[10] Microsoft has invested US$13 billion in OpenAI, and is entitled to 49% of OpenAI Global, LLC\\'s profits, capped at an estimated 10x their investment.[11][12] Microsoft also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.[13]\\n\\nIn 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI\\'s products. In November 2023, OpenAI\\'s board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company\\'s prominent role in an industry-wide problem.[14][15]', 'number': 5, 'subject': 'OPENAI', 'tone': 'SIMPLE', 'RESPONSE_JSON': '{\"1\": {\"no\": \"1\", \"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"2\": {\"no\": \"2\", \"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"3\": {\"no\": \"3\", \"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"4\": {\"no\": \"4\", \"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}}', 'quiz': '{\\n    \"1\": {\\n        \"no\": \"1\",\\n        \"mcq\": \"What is the main goal of OpenAI?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"To develop safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence\",\\n            \"b\": \"To outperform humans in all tasks\",\\n            \"c\": \"To dominate the AI industry\",\\n            \"d\": \"To create entertainment AI models\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"a\"\\n    },\\n    \"2\": {\\n        \"no\": \"2\",\\n        \"mcq\": \"Which of the following is NOT a product known to be developed by OpenAI?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"GPT language models\",\\n            \"b\": \"DALL-E text-to-image models\",\\n            \"c\": \"Sora text-to-video model\",\\n            \"d\": \"VR gaming software\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"d\"\\n    },\\n    \"3\": {\\n        \"no\": \"3\",\\n        \"mcq\": \"In which state is OpenAI, Inc. registered as a non-profit organization?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"California\",\\n            \"b\": \"New York\",\\n            \"c\": \"Delaware\",\\n            \"d\": \"Texas\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"c\"\\n    },\\n    \"4\": {\\n        \"no\": \"4\",\\n        \"mcq\": \"Which company has invested $13 billion in OpenAI and provides computing resources through Microsoft Azure?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Google\",\\n            \"b\": \"Apple\",\\n            \"c\": \"Amazon\",\\n            \"d\": \"Microsoft\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"d\"\\n    },\\n    \"5\": {\\n        \"no\": \"5\",\\n        \"mcq\": \"Why did OpenAI face lawsuits in 2023 and 2024?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"For trademark infringement\",\\n            \"b\": \"For alleged copyright infringement\",\\n            \"c\": \"For security breaches\",\\n            \"d\": \"For unfair competition practices\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"b\"\\n    }\\n}', 'review': '{\"1\": {\"no\": \"1\", \"mcq\": \"What does OpenAI aim to develop?\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)\", \"b\": \"Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\", \"c\": \"Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)\", \"d\": \"Artificial Emotional Intelligence (AEI)\"}, \"correct\": \"b\"}, \"2\": {\"no\": \"2\", \"mcq\": \"Which organization has invested $13 billion in OpenAI?\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"Google\", \"b\": \"Amazon\", \"c\": \"Microsoft\", \"d\": \"Apple\"}, \"correct\": \"c\"}, \"3\": {\"no\": \"3\", \"mcq\": \"What is the name of the text-to-video model developed by OpenAI?\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"AlphaGo\", \"b\": \"ChatGPT\", \"c\": \"DALL-E\", \"d\": \"Sora\"}, \"correct\": \"d\"}, \"4\": {\"no\": \"4\", \"mcq\": \"When was OpenAI founded?\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"December 2015\", \"b\": \"January 2020\", \"c\": \"November 2018\", \"d\": \"March 2017\"}, \"correct\": \"a\"}, \"5\": {\"no\": \"5\", \"mcq\": \"Who was temporarily removed as CEO of OpenAI in November 2023?\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"Elon Musk\", \"b\": \"Sam Altman\", \"c\": \"Jeff Bezos\", \"d\": \"Satya Nadella\"}, \"correct\": \"b\"}}'}\n"
